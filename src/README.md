Notebooks:
- Processing:
  - `1.0.1 GLAMOS pre-processing`: preprocessing of PMB data from GLAMOS
  - `1.0.2 ERA5 pre-processing`: preprocessing of ERA5-Land data
  - `1.0.3 MeteoSuisse grid pre-processing`: preprocessing of MeteoSwiss data
  - `1.0.4 Download ERA5 hourly`: download ERA5-Land data from website (monthly and hourly)
- Models:
  - `1.1.1 miniML-MB-train annual to monthly`: train miniML-MB in different predictor aggregations
  - `1.1.2 PDD model`: run the PDD model
  - `1.1.3 miniML-MB-variable combinations`: run miniML-MB with all variable combinations and clustering of feature importance. Creates Figure 5 & 11
  - `1.1.4 Extreme years`: run miniML-MB on extreme years. Creates Figure 9.
  - `1.1.5 miniML-MB on ERA5`: run miniML-MB with ERA5-Land instead of MeteoSwiss
